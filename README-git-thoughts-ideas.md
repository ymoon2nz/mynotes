**Branch is a particular type of ``commit``**

## My thoughts

**git** is a tool to provide or enables various methods of sharing information between humans and computer systems as well as between computer systems.

To interact with computer systems, we as humans uses interactive devices to feed our requests using punch card, keyboard, mouse and received information by various printed materials and monitor. Also we store this information in storage devices such as tape, disk, SSD, SAN and Cloud.

**git** can plays very important role in this, not only be a method of interaction between humans and computers but also between computers to computers. Typically by adding source codes, definitions and configurations as well as instruction codes such as scripts and programs for  computer system to execute and apply these instructions. This doesn't limit to a single systems but also to multiple computer systems. Because git not only stores, source information but also store information about how they can interact each other and one of its methodology is a DevOps.
